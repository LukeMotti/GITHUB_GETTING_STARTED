# GITHUB GETTING STARTED
This guide is intended to get you started with GitHub and Git. It is not intended 
to be a full manual but it will guide you to (well written) manuals instead providing
ordering of the reading list.

## GitHub Guides
The [GitHug guides)[https://guides.github.com] provides good tutorials for Git and GutHub.
You can read them in the order of appearance but here are some highlights.

### GitHub Handbook
The [GitHub Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) explains the Git
version control system and how it integrates with GitHub.

### Documenting your projects in GitHub
The [Wiki Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) tells how to create README files
(like this one) to give a short project documentation. To do this with GitHub markdown language 
is explained in [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 
(Note the wiki pages are reserved for public repositories.)

### Mastering Issues
GitHub issues are to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. This
is expained in [Mastering Issues]>(https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

## Hello World
The [GitHub Desktop Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) tells you how to use 
GitHub Desktop to manage your project work. It may look overwhelming at start but
just remeber the basic work flow with Git/GitHub:
+ `git clone \<project_url\>
  + Clone the project for the first time to yourself as a local repository
+ `git pull`
  + Update the project from the GitHub repository
+ `git add` \<file\>
  + Prepare the file commit and push
+ `git commit`
  + Update the your local repository with files from previous `git add`
+ `git push`
  + Push the `git commit` updates to the GitHub repository
